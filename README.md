# Mouse Game: A Mobile Application Development 3 Project

## Explanation
Within this repository, you will find my implementation of a design document in which I was provided for the module, Mobile Application Development 3. The game below is a 3D endless runner where the goal is to survive as long as possible, while collecting cheese as you go, as a mouse! Whether you play co-operatively or solo, continue playing until you reach a high-score!
